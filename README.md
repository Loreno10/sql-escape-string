# sql-escape-string [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/thlorenz/sql-escape-string.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/thlorenz/sql-escape-string)

Simple SQL string escape.

```js
const escapeString = require('sql-string-escape')
const sqlString = 'Sup\ter'
console.log(escapeString(sqlString)) // => Sup\\ter
```

## Installation

    npm install sql-escape-string

## Note

Implementation lifted from [sqlstring](https://github.com/mysqljs/sqlstring) with some
adaptations.

-   adapted method is private inside the above module so it cannot be accessed directly there
-   instead you'll have to call `SqlString.escape` which does a bunch of checks to support
    passing `Array`s, `Object`s, etc.
-   here it is exposed directly and thus changed as follows:
    -   passing `null` or `undefined` throws
    -   the passed string is not wrapped in quotes, instead only characters inside it are escaped,
        however if you need that to happen I recommend using [full featured
        escaping](https://github.com/mysqljs/sqlstring#escaping-query-values) provided by
        `sqlstring`.

### escapeString

Escapes the given string to protect against SQL injection attacks'

NOTE: the string is not quoted after it is escaped, therefore either use parameterized
queries and/or process it further via modules like [squel](https://github.com/hiddentao/squel)

NOTE for MYSQL users: These methods of escaping values only works when the
[NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_backslash_escapes)
SQL mode is disabled (which is the default state for MySQL servers)

**Parameters**

-   `val` **[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** the original string to be used in a SQL query

Returns **[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** the original string escaped and safe to use
